# Titanic Survival Prediction

Author: Clay Tryon

## Project Description
This project analyzes passenger data from the RMS Titanic to determine which features most influenced survival. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived based on attributes like class, age, fare, sex, and family aboard. This is achieved using machine learning models to classify each passenger as survived or not. I also wanted to determine what the strongest predictive factors were in a persons survival. 

## Machine Learning Algorithm Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier (with class balancing and hyperparameter tuning)

## Machine Learning Libraries Used
